**Welcome to the exciting world of A-star search algorithm in a 2D gaming environment!**

This project is a game that showcases the power and versatility of the A-star search algorithm through an engaging gameplay experience.

The A-star search algorithm is a widely used pathfinding algorithm and is especially efficient in finding the shortest path between two points in a graph or grid. This game leverages the algorithm to provide an interactive and visually appealing experience.

Features:

Pygame platform: The design was built on the pygame platform to create a seamless experience when being used

Dynamic Grid: The game presents a visually appealing 2D grid where each cell represents a unique location. The position of the goal changes randomly, allowing players to explore various scenarios.

Objective-based Gameplay: Players are presented with specific objectives, such as reaching a goal, collecting items, or avoiding obstacles. They must strategically navigate through the grid by selecting neighboring cells and/or employing the A-star search algorithm to find the optimal path.

Real-time Pathfinding: As players make their initial play choice, the A-star search algorithm calculates the most efficient path in real-time. This provides instant feedback and allows for dynamic gameplay where decisions have immediate consequences.

Customizable Heuristics: The game allows players to experiment with different heuristic functions to influence the A-star search algorithm's decision-making process. By adjusting heuristics, players can observe how it affects the pathfinding behavior and optimize the strategies accordingly.

Visualization and Statistics: The game provides clear visual representations of the explored nodes, open and closed sets, and the final path found by the algorithm. Additionally, it offers statistics such as time, and score.

User-friendly Interface: The game features an intuitive and easy-to-use interface, allowing players to interact with the grid effortlessly. They can select cells, toggle obstacles, and initiate pathfinding with a few simple clicks, making it accessible to both beginners and experienced developers.
